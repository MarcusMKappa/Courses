### Tableau 10 A-Z
#### Course Description
This course starts with the basics of Tableau. You'll learn how to navigate the program, how to connect to a data file, and how to export a worksheet, so even beginners won't have any problems here. To find trends in your data and make the right predictions, you will learn how to work with data extracts and time series data. Also to make your data easier to understand, you'll master how to use aggregation to summarize information. You will use the level of detail to ensure correct calculations. To get started with data visualization, we will master how to create various charts, maps, and interactive dashboards for each of your projects. You'll even learn when it's best to use join versus blend to properly work with and present information from multiple sources. Finally, we'll also master the last and most advanced data preparation features in Tableau 10, where you'll create table calculations, chart tree maps, and scenarios. After completing this training, you will become a very proficient Tableau user. You will be able to use your data analysis skills to extract knowledge from data to analyze and visualize complex problems easily. You will be fully prepared to collect, explore, and present data for any purpose, whether it is data science or the need to forecast purchasing trends to increase profits.
